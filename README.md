# Bio

*Full control of input on any level.*

## âœ… Why choose Bio?

**Bio** allows monitoring keyboard input on *any* level of abstraction. It provides an easy-to-use wrapper for the native Win32 low-level keyboard hook as well as the class for working with detected input in a sophisticated way with a * rich* set of information about each input event.

## ðŸ”© Usage
### Low-level Hook
```C#
using Bio;

using var hook = new KeyboardHook();
hook.Set();
hook.KeyDown += Hook_HandleLowLevelInputMessage;
hook.KeyUp += Hook_HandleLowLevelInputMessage;
hook.Mute();
hook.Unmute();

void Hook_HandleLowLevelInputMessage(object? sender, KeyboardInputMessage e)
{
    var wm = e.WM;
    var lowLevelKeyInfo = e.KBDLLHOOKSTRUCT;
}
```

### High-level Input Detector
```C#
using Bio;
using Bio.Win32;

using var keySpy = new KeySpy();
keySpy.Activate();
keySpy.InputDetected += KeySpy_HandleHighLevelInputEvent;
keySpy.Mute();
keySpy.Unmute();

void KeySpy_HandleHighLevelInputEvent(object? sender, KeyInfo e)
{
    // KeyInfo is basically an advanced version of ConsoleKeyInfo that supports all keys and can differentiate between left and right modifier keys.
    VK vkCode = e.VK;
    char keyChar = e.KeyChar;
    ConsoleKey consoleKey = e.ConsoleKey;
    ModifierKeys modifierKeys = e.ModifierKeys;
}
```

### Input Synthesizer
```C#
using Bio;
using Bio.Win32;

KeyboardInput.SynthesizePress(VK.LSHIFT, VK.KEY_A);
KeyboardInput.Synthesize(WM.KEYDOWN, VK.KEY_0);
KeyboardInput.Synthesize(WM.KEYUP, VK.KEY_0);
```
